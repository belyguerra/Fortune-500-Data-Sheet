# Fortune-500-Data-Sheet
Dataset for creating Fortune 500 data visualization. Initial dataset from http://topforeignstocks.com/downloads/ . You can create something like this: http://beta.fortune.com/global500/visualizations/?iid=recirc_g500landing-zone1
I have cleaned up the dataset and have added Headquarter Lat, Lon coordinates for creating maps.(Using Google's GeoCode Api)
The initial list was compiled by Fortune in 2015.

Fields: GlobalRank	CompanyName	Sector	HQLocation	lat	lng	Revenues	Profits	Employees
